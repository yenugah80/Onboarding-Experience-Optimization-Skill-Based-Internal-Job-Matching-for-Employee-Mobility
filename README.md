Onboarding Experience Optimization & Skill-Based Internal Job 
Matching for Employee Mobility 
Problem Statement 
Many organizations struggle with engaging and retaining employees due to inefficient 
onboarding processes and difficulty identifying skills gaps. New hires often face delays in 
accessing tools, inconsistent training, and poor integration into company culture, leading to 
disengagement and turnover. To address this, i propose a real-time tracking system for onboarding 
progress and satisfaction, using feedback to adjust training and support. Additionally, 
organizations find it hard to pinpoint specific skills gaps, hindering employee development. I 
suggest developing a model to identify these gaps based on job descriptions and employee skills, 
recommending personalized training paths. Techniques like NLP, Time Series Analysis, 
Clustering, and Recommendation Systems will be used to create a comprehensive solution. 
Plan 
Objectives 
Primary Goal: Improve employee satisfaction and career mobility by optimizing the onboarding 
experience and facilitating internal job matching based on employees’ skills and aspirations. 
Secondary Goals: Increase retention rates and enhance talent utilization across the organization. 
Methodology and Analytical Techniques 
Data Collection and Integration: 
• Gather employee data, including onboarding feedback, skill assessments, and role preferences. 
• Use NLP for text analysis on qualitative feedback and employee profiles. 
• Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: 
• Clean and standardize data from HR systems. 
• Engineer new features from onboarding feedback and skill data to capture engagement levels 
and skill compatibility. 
Descriptive Analytics: 
Use summary statistics and visualizations to understand trends in onboarding satisfaction 
and identify common pain points. 
Predictive Modeling: 
Develop a classification model using algorithms like CatBoost or Random Forest to predict 
role fit based on employees’ skills, aspirations, and feedback. 
Recommendation System: 
Build a recommendation engine for job matching, applying techniques like collaborative 
filtering and content-based recommendations. 
Project Phases and Timeline 
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Data Collection and Preprocessing 
• Gather data on employee skills, job descriptions, and onboarding feedback. 
• Clean and standardize the data to ensure consistency. 
• Use NLP to process text data from feedback and profiles. 
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Descriptive Analytics and Initial Model Development 
• Perform descriptive analytics to understand trends in onboarding satisfaction and identify  
common pain points. 
• Develop initial models to identify skills gaps and predict role fit based on employee data. 
Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Build and Refine the Recommendation Engine 
• Develop a recommendation engine for job matching using techniques like collaborative 
filtering and content-based recommendations. 
• Refine the engine based on initial results and feedback. 
Phase 4 (Week 7): Integration and Testing 
• Integrate the recommendation engine with the dashboard. 
• Conduct testing to ensure the system works as expected. 
• Gather feedback from HR teams and make necessary adjustments. 
Phase 5 (Week 8): Finalization and Presentation 
• Finalize the dashboard and recommendation engine based on testing and feedback. 
• Prepare a presentation to showcase the final outcomes, insights, and recommendations. 
 
 
Challenges and Mitigation Strategies 
• Data Integration Issues: Inconsistent formats or missing values could hinder data analysis. 
• Mitigation: Collaborate closely with IT to ensure data standardization and use preprocessing 
techniques to handle missing data. 
• Model Bias: Training data may contain historical biases that could affect job matching 
recommendations. 
• Mitigation: Implement fairness-aware machine learning methods and conduct regular bias 
checks to promote equity. 
• Feedback Collection Variability: Variability in onboarding timelines may delay feedback 
collection. 
• Mitigation: Automate feedback collection at key milestones to ensure timely and consistent 
data. 
Expected Outcomes 
• A structured system for real-time tracking and evaluation of onboarding processes. 
• A recommendation engine to assist HR in identifying skill-aligned internal roles, increasing 
engagement and retention. 
• Actionable insights for optimizing onboarding and job matching strategies across the 
organization. 
By addressing these challenges through data-driven analysis and advanced analytical 
techniques, this project aims to create a more engaged, satisfied, and productive workforce. This 
will not only improve employee retention but also ensure that the organization makes the best use 
of its talent, ultimately leading to better overall performance.
